µstack (pronounced "microstack") is a tiny self-hosted markdown blogging
platform. It allows writers and creators to serve content directly to their
audience, without a third party in the middle.

- **Simplicity**: µstack does not require any coding skills. µstack can be used
  by anyone who understands markdown and has the ability to host their own web
  server.
- **Accessibility:** µstack blogs are easy for screen-reader software to handle,
  making them accessible to people with visual disabilities. µstack blogs are
  extremely lightweight, making them accessible to people with older devices,
  and people with poor internet connections.
- **Aesthetics:** µstack blogs use the design language of the modern web. The
  blog's owner can customize its appearance, as well.
